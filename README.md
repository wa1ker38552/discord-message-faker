A simple website with minimalistic UI that allows you to fake Discord messages. Works making a Discord message template and allowing the user to edit as they please. Live instance hosted [here](https://dmf.cadenchau.com)

To save the template, just take a screenshot. You might need to resize it to make it more accurate.

**üêõ (I'm not gonna fix these because I'm too lazy)**
1. Overflow on text for username, content, and timestamp goes off the page/wraps
2. Avatar turns a little goofy when viewport is too small
